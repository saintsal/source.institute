                <p>Source Institute is a skunkworks that <a href="https://community.source.institute/t/the-source-thesis/47 ">uses peer learning</a> as a <a href="http://peerlearning.is">systematic discipline</a>.  
                <p>We've used peer learning to help world-leading organisations, and entrepreneurs in some of the world's fastest-changing environments: startups, humanitarian engineering technologies, and blockchain.

                        <p>I'm Salim Virani. I've developed entrepreneur training with 5 of the world's top 10 universities (Oxford, UCL, Imperial, Cambridge, Harvard)  and half the world's best-performing startup accelerators (Seedcamp, Techstars, 500 Startups, EntrepreneurFirst) as well as other world-class organisations like The Royal Academy Of Engineering, Unilever, and Microsoft. Before that, I founded companies in ecommerce, IT provision and SaaS. 
                        <p>These days, I support a few blockchain-related education projects, but my focus is on returning to being a maker again.</p>
