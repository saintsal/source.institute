                <p>Source Institute is a skunkworks for <a href="https://community.source.institute/t/the-source-thesis/47 ">developing peer learning</a> into a <a href="http://peerlearning.is">robust, systematic discipline</a>.  
                <p>I've used peer learning to help world-leading organisations, and entrepreneurs in some of the world's fastest-changing environments.
                Now, I've switched focus to <a href="https://salimvirani.com/portfolios ">tools that directly empower people</a>.
