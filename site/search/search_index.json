We're enabling the early generation of the Polygon ecosystem through grants, education and support. Bankless DAO 2021- Bankless DAO is a large-scale DAO aligned to help the world go bankless by using fairer, decentralised alternatives. I'm working within the DAO to help impliment peer learning best practices, helping surface and share defi (decentralised finance) expert practices, and optimise content creation for various DAO projects. LimeAcademy 2021 LimeAcademy is a developer training course run by LimeChain, one of Bulgaria's leading blockchain development agencies. Using Mentor Impact (see below), I trained the senior developers to be mentors, and aligned the program around desired learner capabilities and behaviours. Startup ecosystem building Leancamp 2009-2014 The global community that shaped the Lean Startup methodology. Centered around unconferences that connected entrepreneurs with UX, sales, business model researchers and other disciplines. Ran in 30+ cities through a network of volunteer organisers. European Commission 2015-2017 Repeat evaluator for Horizon 2020 grants. H2020 was a ten-year EU-wide programme designed to seed startup ecosystems across Europe. Seedcamp 2013-2014 Designed and ran a touring, one-day workshop for Seedcamp. It had a dual-purpose, to teach a set of practical startup skills and to surface good investment candidates. Full program design & delivery The Africa Prize 2014-2017 A pan-African support program for African engineers tackling African challenges. Heavy use of facilitated peer support and startup community interaction made multiplied the key success metrix by 5X. Leaders In Innovation Fellowship 2015-2017 A commercialisation bootcamp program that accepted ~300 engineers from 15 countries each year. Reached pinnacle status within The Newton Fund due to its ability to acheive consistently high results for cohorts of different cultures. Village Accelerator 2016-2017 Over a year, trained a group of Roma teenagers to code. This proof-of-concept was notably successful because of the emphasis on peer support. There's an overlap between software developer culture and Roma culture, that activated self-direction in the teenagers. AIESEC Startup Deep Dive 2016-2017 An 8-hour, hands-on workshop, simulating the muddy exploration and hard decisions that founders face when getting their ideas off the ground. Based on a program we developed for Oxford University, it was redesigned so it could be delivered by students for world-wide deployment. ING Bank 2015-2016 Provided startup mentoring and peer learning components for the ING PACE innovation program. Peer learning correlated to top performers. Program design Sofia Tech Park 2018 Commissioned to design and deploy an education program for Sofia Tech Park. With 11 different world-class labs in various disciplines, the main challenge was helping them find paths-to-market that are viable from the Bulgarian business climate.

The Source Way built up practices to make it easer for new people to start, and easier for larger groups to keep up with a bunch of parallel projects. Remote work without the meetings \"Remote\" is a totally different way of working. You can't just start using Zoom and chatrooms, otherwise they take over your life. There's actual work to do, and we want to optimise for the people who actually get things done. With Source collaborations, we have very few meetings, and no video call or chatrooms required. (They always end up horrible, so why make people use them.) At Source, everyone has mostly uninterrupted days to really get things done. They are in control of their own schedule, and rarely have to work around other people's timezones or personal routines. A lot of people can't imagine remote work without calls and chats, but the switch to this kind of remote work is actually easy! It just needs people to turn their attention to self-awareness, to jump in to new habits, and help each other break our old ones. The Source Rules Of Remote How does Source work practically? A few easy rules: Every week or so, write a quick note to update everyone with your current priorities. If you get mentioned on the forum, reply within one business day. (This makes the forum the single source of truth). If a teammate calls, get back to them the same day. (And don't call if it's not important enough to require a call back the same day.) If you're on a squad, commit to be on the weekly standup call, which is voice-only and 20 minutes max. (It's a great deal, to free your week of all other meetings.) At the end of the project, everyone attends the retrospective and shares the conclusions on the forum so we all learn from each other. This way of communicating gives us a lot of control over our schedule, and a lot more free time, but it needs us to rethink our roles and responsibilities. Choose \"Async\" Favour asynchronous communication (like the forum) over synchronous (chat and voice). And specifically - if something's important, we put it on the forum. Thoughts on big decisions, teammate updates, etc. - that stuff goes in writing because: it's inclusive - everyone is in the loop it's respectful - we can read and respond on own schedule it promotes thoughtfulness - writing helps us articulate our thinking more clearly from the start Squads instead of managers Squads form around projects (with one-time end results) or factories (to produce a similar output repeatedly) Squads are a maximum of 4 people to stay agile. If a squad needs to be bigger than 4 people, we instead designate 2-3 people as squad members (drive the boat) and the rest as water-skiiers (follow and help when pulled in.) Squad members pick their own tools. The organisation doesn't force tools on them, but also nobody outside of the squad is expected to use the tools the squad uses. Each squad member holds themselves accountable. The best thing about no manager is also the worst -- there's nobody there the chase you. Teams prioritise together Squads take responsibility for their results and direction, and report that to everyone else. Squads set their own OKRs but these are usually related to higher-level OKRs set by the organisation leadership. My squads have a single, mandatory 20-minute agile standup call that happens at the same time each week. No updates or \"while I've got you\" stuff, since those happened already on the forum. We only prioritize the upcoming week's work together. Organizing around priorities, not tasks Everyone communicates their top 3+ priorities (what they're working on, and their short-term goals) every week or so. This way, everyone knows what's going on and if they should connect with each other. It also creates a sense of peer accountability and peer support. Watch out for \"ripples\" Teamwork is interconnected, so if someone's stuck or delayed, it affects others. In remote teams, this is harder to see, so it's important to speak up if you're stuck. If someone is completely stuck, call a \"block\" so all hands drop what they're doing and come to their support. Blocks are immediately followed by a 30-minute root cause session, so we can use the opportunity to improve for next time. Reject urgency It's disrupted when someone does something last-minute, and ends up pulling everyone into that last-minuteness. If this becomes a pattern, everyone gets caught up in the urgent instead of the important. But we can break these urgency habits, leaving us all in flow, working calmly while still seeing big results. Chat is for social stuff only The worst thing in the universe is having to follow yet another chatroom. We so no to FOMO. Chat is strictly for social, fun and random stuff only. So its optional and you can tune out without worry. (Because if it's important, it's on the forum anyway!) Calls are 1-to-1 and unscheduled Calls are used sparingly, but sometimes a voice conversation is the right way to go. Things like brainstorms, quick clarifications, or discussions that involve a lot of Q&A back-and-forth - and anything that gets a little emotional -- it's time for a call. After the call, write a quick note on the forum so everyone's in the loop and clear. That's it. Simple, and its worked great. It just takes some commitment and some getting used to.","title":"Working in Remote Squads"},{"location":"about/squads/#working-in-remote-squads","text":"This is a quick intro to how I work with new collaborators at Source, so we can hit the ground running with best practices.

We've only published a few here, but we're happy to share more if you can't find your use case here. Turning a large group into a community A conference or a large chatroom is often called a community, but is it? We define community as a place where like-minded people find each other and form meaningful relationships. Once people are drawn together, that's half the challenge. The other half is helping them find each other. Flocks (as in \"birds of a feather flock together\") is a way to help people find their flock in a large space. Really helping each other Community leaders and educators often think about inviting experts, either to give talks or answer questions. But often the answers to individual challenges isn't found in an expert, but a peer who's walked down the same road. Our experience taught us that sharing practical experience (not talking about it, but doing it) is more likely to build connections and knowledge in a community. Even invited experts get better results with practical ways to engage rather than just being a talking head. (And for them, it's both funner and more educational.) Clinic is a way for a project-based learner to get more apprenticeship-like guidance from someone else.

Purpose To allow people to find their peer-group in a large group Use When Starting deeper relationships amongst a large number of attendees is desirable. Overview A lot of people pushing the state of the art don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re succeeding. Flocks aims to allow people to find each other based on commonalities in their personal struggles. Since many people have part of the answer, just meeting each other allows them to connect their pieces \u2013 allowing more holistic and thorough solutions to form. The format starts by stating this, and then inviting people to fill out a Flocks poster. They quickly present it, and post it on a wall somewhere in the room, where they stay. After the posters are created, people circulate the room like a tradeshow, gravitating to the posters that resonate with them and meeting like-minded people. Download the PDF here Warning This poster may seem simple, but it has important helper text that are make-or-break for this format to work. Peer Learning Principles Learners take responsibility of their learning journey. Educators create environments that inspire and allow them to self-direct. Create safe spaces so the learner can ask real questions and reveal true challenges. Systematically create relationships to supply the most relevant sources of experience to the learning demand. Those may be authorities, or maybe those just a few steps ahead. Preparation Print out large (A2 or A1) Flocks posters. Print roughly 10-20% of the number of people who will be in the room. Print out small (A4) Flocks posters. Print roughly 20% of the number of people who will be in the room. Keep the posters with felt-tip pens at the front of the room on a few large tables so multiple people can write their poster. (The small posters are for practice.) Process Time Action Tips 2- 5 minutes Intro talk. Set the tone about what innovation feels like. Use examples of people in the room if you can. If not, tell early-stage stories of big innovators before they were famous. Allow 2-3 minutes for lining up and writing, then up to 15 minutes for presenting. Poster Post-Up: everyone lines up to make posters, and when they are ready they present them for 20 seconds. Try to only allow high-level clarifying questions and keep it moving fast. People should use the \u201ctrade show\u201d time for clarifying questions (not on stage). Remainder (30-60 minutes) Trade Show: people who wrote posters man their station. The others walk around freely. (Poster-makers can start walking around half-way through too.) Circulate the room like you\u2019re hosting a party. Make intros. Encourage people with similar posters to hang them near each other.

Flocks aims to allow people to find each other based on commonalities in their personal struggles. Since many people have part of the answer, just meeting each other allows them to connect their pieces \u2013 allowing more holistic and thorough solutions to form. The format starts by stating this, and then inviting people to fill out a Flocks poster. They quickly present it, and post it on a wall somewhere in the room, where they stay. After the posters are created, people circulate the room like a tradeshow, gravitating to the posters that resonate with them and meeting like-minded people.

Purpose To allow others to learn from someone\u2019s practical experience. Useful when Context is important for the learner, and they need to process others\u2019 experience in terms of relevance to them and/or the skills necessary to succeed. Overview It\u2019s one thing to explain to someone how you did something, quite another to show them. People remember relevant lessons when they feel like they were there, and advice is much easier to understand in the context of practicalities, so that\u2019s what we try to do with Show & Tell. Show & Tell allows someone with a relevant experience \u2013 either successful or not -- to share valuable lessons learned. Rather than just tell a story, walking through it step-by-step prompts contextual explanations and questions. Walking through it with the key tools and artifacts makes the entire exercise practical. When those particular artifacts are shown up front, then the story, the lessons learned and the conclusion (if any) can all be discussed around that. Preparation The presenter just needs to come prepared to walk the audience through their work. This could mean bringing their computer with a project loaded, bringing the physical artifact they worked on. If neither of those are possible, pictures showing the step-by-step of their actual work will do. Process Time Action Tips 2 minutes Introduce the story and the artifact Show the thing first, and explain why this is what you\u2019re showing. Then set context with the time and place, and the beginning of the challenge. 5-10 minutes Play-by-play Walk through the process as it actually happened in a specific case . Remainder Questions & practical discussion Try to keep it around the presenter\u2019s experience.
