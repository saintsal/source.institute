There are significant differences though: The org structure is very decentralised, enabling us to act as a swarm or independently as needed. Our squads are far more independent, choosing their own goals and tools. Our strategy is more emergent, and more informed by the front-line. Squad captains contribute to strategy. We call our approach the Speedboat Armada. Each squad is like a speedboat, with waterskiiers in tow. Each is self-directed, but coordinates with the others. Source OS The Source Operation System is our way of working, defined as a few simple practices. The idea with an \"Operating System\" with versions is to give everyone a clear sense of how things work, and we can step change with less confusion, rather than slowly shifting and trying to catch people up. Like an OS for your computer let's you focus on your work without needing to worry about how the computer works, Source OS is designed to allow you to focus on your work with almost no effort put towards management and coordination. (Coordination becomes a by-product of doing the real work.) The priority is to achieve connection and growth with our communities through the various products we have. Each product has a constituent user group: Leancamp, Deep Dive, Mentor Impact, Partnership Design, Decision Hacks, Source Summit, Brain Trust etc. The priority is to get Captains to (wo)man the boats, and to take initiatives in new squards to explore new ways to enable peer learning communities. Source OS is designed for Initiative Wayfinding Surplus time Personal development Source OS is designed to allow us to take initiatives of our own. If you have an idea, get it going yourself or start a speedboat. You're the captain of your own ship within the Source armada, and we coordinate at the Armada meeting every 2 months. So basically, we're aiming for more, smaller, self-directed teams that align themselves quarterly. The intention here is to step away from the problems caused by the lack of structure we've had previously, where we would wait for an initiative to get started by someone else, and then everyone would jump on it at once. This created a lot of needless complication, confusion and extra work for the initiators, and overloaded projects too early, just as they were getting momentum. Ultimately, creating organisational weakness at sales, communication and in delivering projects. So with Source OS, taking unilateral initiative on a project you lead is encouraged, and where you're not the squad leader or on the core team (on the speedboat), then you're expected to make yourself available to be delegated to. Urgency/busyness seems to be a constant everywhere. Although busyness hurts the business, it\u2019s fiercely contagious since the infected (aka busy people) are visibly suffering and thus seem to have the moral high-ground. Without active opposite pressure, their long hours and off-handed comments (\u201cwell, back to the old grindstone\u201d, \u201cyou guys go on home, I\u2019m going to get a little more done\u201d) will eventually swing the team. The biggest problem with this is that the people who can't manage their time well are always making themselves and others busy with busywork (meetings, impractical documentation, etc.) and fundamentally not getting results. As the team gravitates into their meeting blackhole, nobody gets results. Creating surplus time individually creates a new gravity well towards calm work that gets better results. Why? When you have surplus time, you make yourself available to act on the best opportunities, and act with the calmness and sure-footedness of someonw fresh and well-rested. With a busy schedule, there's no room to maneuvre and no gas left in the tank when you need it. So Source OS is designed to free everyone from meetings and busywork so we can all focus on real work, and be ready when needed to get the big results. Self-improvement and peer-support go hand in hand. This started on Day 1 on the beach in Gradina, and it's part of Source culture I really want to defend and grow. There is a skill-set part of personal development, relating to what we consider to be quality entrepreneurship education, and the role of the facilitator/curator there. There is also a creation part of personal development. Source is a resource you can employ to create great new things. What will you use Source for to make, and deliver on what the world needs? The Speedboat Armada Model We are not a hierarchical company, we are an armada of speedboats, Mad Max style! Imagine an armada of speedboats, with waterskiiers in tow. Each project has leadership , sitting on the speedboat. They take responsibility for leading, organising, and they make the decisions. They drive the boat, and also do all the main work. These on-boat teams should stay small like startup founding teams so they can remain quick. If you're not in the leadership (on the boat), you can be a waterskiier (on a rope). This means you're willing to help, and to be pulled in. You follow the project's updates, and are responsive on internal communications. This could be part of the delivery, or it can be an offer to advise, take calls, etc. The idea is that we can use On Boat (core to delivery, making decisions) and On Rope (watching, ready and able to be delegated specific responsibilities) as shortcuts to set expectations on commitment and communication. You'll hear things like \"I'm on rope on Erasmus+\" meaning they're following that project and have made their availabilit to happy clear. With smaller core teams, we'll be more efficient and quicker to jump on opportunities. Also, we get better at building momentum since our energy goes into growth and impact, rather than management and coordination. Projects should start with just leadership, and people can rope on. The leaders can \"pull people in\", as they're needed. The trade off is that unless you start a squad (or commit to it very early), you're going to be more of a \"band-wagon jumper\" so you might have to wait longer for the momentum to build up, before the project's engine is strong enough to tow you. (Consider LIF in London and The Africa Prize in Ghana, with too many waterskiiers to coordinate. This is why we want to organise ourselves for smaller teams.) One of the big ideas with this shift is to create an incentive for everyone to take the lead on something new, and build a small agile team to do it, building lots of powerful engines to pull us. That's way more effective than pooling a lot of resources into a single team with a lot of different objectives to manage. With the Speedboat Armada Model, we create space to see more leadership emerge within Source without bumping into existing initiatives. If you see a way to enable peer learning at Source or with Source's help, go for it. You'll gain our support, and will even probably attract a small squad around you. You just need to agree on OKRs with the other squad captains and the admiral and you're all set. Products, not projects Speedboats deliver user-focused products. They are not defined by general work (projects) but outputs that deliver specific value to specific groups of people (products). Speedboats are agile Squads, multi-disciplinary teams that deliver value to the user at the end of every one or two-week sprint. Projects have goals that serve the host organisation. Products have goals that serve the user. When you organise into product teams, you break work down, not by function, but by value to the end-user. User Stories, not tasks A specific Agile technique called User Stories is the unit of progress. Shipping something that achieves the user stories allows the squad to self-organise and do what needs doing to deliver value, rather than require a manager to chase tasks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGeDZmrWwsw Internally functional Speedboats have every function they need on their squad. When you break up your teams by function, then you create interdependency. This slows us down because each squad is going to end up waiting on others. This leads to more need for planning and management overhead, and less time for doing. It also leads to feeling like you shouldn't do what makes sense for you because it might mess with another project. Product teams have everyone they need in the squad and can act. The squad doesn't need to check in with anyone but themselves for operational issues. (Only the Captain needs to update OKRs every 2 months and confidence levels every month.). There's less time needed for meetings and talking, and more of a culture of \"let's just try this and let the results speak for themselves.\" Results-oriented Speedboats hold themselves accountable to results. The Product Owner sets success metrics and the team then implements a way to track them. Each sprint, the team reviews their work against performance, and learns and adapts accordingly. As a self-directing team, the squad members don't wait for management to check the metrics and suggest course-corrections, but check the metrics, make suggestions and act on them themselves. Self-directing Speedboats set and communicate their objectives. To be a Source Institute captain, you must have contributed to a Source community project already. The Source Institute captains set OKRs which are agreed by the admiral and fellow captains. Roles Source basically revolves around speedboat \"Crews\" that work as small self-directed teams. Crews have a Captain and a First Mate. Crews are supported by Waterskiiers who follow along and help when pulled in. Outside of Crews, Admirals work to help Captains coordinate within the armada. Coordination Admirals coordinate the speedboats at a high level. They have influence over the speedboats objectives, but not their operations. They mainly act as information providers to help the Captains decide on objectives. They understand the goals and direction of the speedboats, help them avoid overlapping (on goals) and colliding (competing for resources) by bridging communications between Captains where needed. They also look ahead to where these groups of boats are heading in the medium and long-term, doing recon, research, making useful connections, and generally making sure the coast is clear. Note In the long run, we expect Admirals to be replaced by fully advisory roles, effectively waterskiiers responsible to Captains. Boats Captain - Each speaedboat is lead by a captain which is responsible for setting and achieving the squad's results. Captains are self-appointed on squads they create. They are responsible for the opportunity, results, design and delivery. In Agile, the Product Owner. First Mate - responsible for the organisation of the team and finances of the project. In Agile, the Delivery Manager or Scrum Master. Crew - part of the delivery team of a project. They are skill-complete, including whoever is necessary to do their work. The makeup differs by squad - could be a facilitator, coder, marketer... Crews make the decisions together and do the work, and importantly they take responsibility for achieving the OKR. In Agile terms, Crew is a synonym for squad. They are the core 2-4 people delivering the product. Water-skiiers - help the crew by making themselves available and contributing when asked. They are responsible for keeping up with the progress of the crew, but only accept specific responsibilities when someone in the crew delegates to them. For example, they are not on the weekly meetings, but still expected to follow along the async crew communication and be responsive when they are tagged in a forum message. These map to Agile roles Product Owner Scrum Master Squad The product leader takes on the role of product owner which means it's their responsibility to understand the customers, users, stakeholders and the strategic needs of Source. Their job is to set priorities with the team, and be available as a check-in or proxy for the rest of the team when there's a question about what's right for the user. The delivery manager sets the team up for successful delivery. Remove obstacles, or blockers to progress, constantly helping the team become more self organising. They enable the work a team does rather than impose how it\u2019s done. Their role in this is to facilitate project meetings- including stand-ups , sprint planning meetings , and retrospectives . They also track progress and produce artefacts for showing this, like burn down/up charts. They must be able to enable the team to produce estimates of how much effort is required to produce features that the Product Manager wants. The team self-organises to delver (ship) working products at the end of every sprint. They work with the priorities set with the Product Owner and Delivery Manager, but have control over how those objectives are delivered. For more information on this, see the GDS guide to Agile . Self-coordination Mechanisms Personal check-ins (Everyone) Check-ins is where we give quick, high-level updates on what we're doing. It's also where we ask for updates on anything we're not actively involved with, but are considering collaborating with. Check-ins are written on the forum in the Check-Ins category, and usually written as a short bullet point list of priorities for the coming month or so. Speedboats (All Crews) Weekly Standup (20 minutes) If you're on a squad or on a short rope, then you need to be on the Standup for that project -- they're usually weekly. That's where we make sure everyone's in sync. Weekly Standup Agenda 1. Walk The Board 2. Retrospectives 3.Sprint Planning Walk the board - we look through the current Kanban board for the proejct, covering each User Story that is still in \"Doing\" and comment on any progress or blocks if need-be. Surface blocks - if there are any other blocks that haven't been called out yet, we raise them The point of a weekly retro is to fix any minor problems in the team and to make sure you keep doing the things that are working. Usually this isn't needed, but this is a time that anyone can flag an issue for the team to run a root cause analysis. The goal is to target process problems so we can address them as a team. Anyone can also flag a process improvement for analysis too. Retrospectives produce a short Lessons Learned bullet points, which are for the team's reference, and for future team members or other Source teams to learn from our experience. This is where we take things off the backlog, add them to the \"To Do\" column for this week's sprint. The Product Owner will lead this, moving cards over to To Do, and the team will estimate the difficulty of that using a technique called Planning Poker, where everyone shows their difficulty estimate of the user story on a card. If there is a divergence, we talk about it and resolve it. With an understanding of difficulty, the Product Owner can set priorities for the coming sprint. If you want to dig into this a bit more, check out the GDS intro to Agile . Strategic Coordination (Captains and Admirals) Squad setup A squad starts with the Captain writing a one-page overview, containing: Objectives and first OKRs Definition of the user group they're addressing What they'll have that user group do, with a product concept Who's on their team This gets shared on the forum and the admirals and other captains are tagged. Squad check-in Every three to four weeks, the Captain shares a new update on the forum with few bullet points for: Update confidence levels for each OKR Current Priorities Pull/Help needed Metrics Recent Wins Recent Lessons Learned This is done as frequently as this key information changes, but never more than a month between check=ins. Check-ins are used by: Collaborators - to know where they can help Captains - to ensure their direction is coordinated and supported by the armada Admirals - to understand progress and direction, and respond helpfully Armada meeting It's good to have speed boats, and agility, but it's also important to coordinate on course, and make sure that ropes don't get tangled. If you have an idea for a project, just start it, set your OKRs and talk to the other captains. You have until the next Armada meeting to get agreement on your OKRs. Each squad has a Captain who takes responsibility for that squad achieving goals that fit the Institute's goals. All Captains meet quarterly to check in on their progress. The Armada meeting is the first Friday of the month, every 3 months: March, June, September, December. We discuss which projects we have on-going, or what new speed boats are about to put into the water. All proposals for existing or new speedboats are shared in advance of the meeting, written as OKRs. The meeting itself is organised for question, relevant discussions, using Accordance Dialogues.. A pro-forma agenda for the Captains meeting would be: A round where progress on targets is shared, and new targets for the next quarter are set for each squad. New projects, or directions are proposed by captains. These are then screened against larger goals for Source Institute, and their potential for community cross-overs (this is to prevent fragmentation of our efforts over separate communities) The main purpose of the armada meeting is to ensure the armada is moving in the same direction. We do this by scrutinising each squads targets, and holding ourselves accountable. General vs Application-level An emerging but key distinguishing factor in our initiatives have been what is general versus what is applied peer learning. For example, Leancamp is an application of a general technique, unconferences. We can work on growing and organising Leancamp and its related communities, or we can work on developing unconferences themselves, and look for other applications beyond Lean or startup communities. Another example, The Sources is an application of on-demand storytelling. We can apply on-demand storytelling for educating geoduck divers or freedom fighters . But first, we have to develop the general technique with The Sources. Ideally, we develop both in parallel as both together will drive Source towards its impact goals, but generally we find that the most useful research and R&D starts with a real need. Those usually look like a simple novel solution, which we later develop into something more broadly useful at Source Camps. Our goal here is to drive more rounded and meaningful research and development by placing Source in Pasteur's Quadrant - where both basic and applied research in peer learning are relevant. Communication Protecting our way of working, and respecting each others' time both come down to the every day choices we make about communication channels. In a nutshell, Source uses asynchronous communication for group discussions, voice chat for 1:1 conversations (only when needed) and text chat is optional and for random/social stuff only. Our communication culture is similar to Basecamp, and their communication guide is worth a read to understand the ethos. But let's get practical for now. The forum is for all discussions that: are important enough to need to be referred to after tomorrow require more than 30 seconds to respond The forum is divided into different categories so you can follow along or ignore and catch up later: The Check-In category is for high-level updates Each speedboat team has it's own category for their own discussions There are open categories for general and public discussions Chat on Telegram is for: random, social stuff quick answers that don't require time to respond and where you care more about a fast answer than a thoughtful one (Nobody is required to be on chat, only on the forum.) Squads will use their own tracking tools, which sometimes remove the need for the forum for their internal comms (but Check-Ins are still required). It tends to be Pivotal Tracker, Trello or Basecamp, depending on their methodology. Why forums over chat? On chat, discussions are pretty much over when they scroll off the page. Without that context, restarting a discussion that took place a few days ago is difficult, let alone a few months ago. Chat content basically dissolves. Plus the busier chat gets, the more people feel pressure to live in chat, so everyone ends up hating it. On forums, it is easy to continue discussions over any period of time. New members can even pick up on a conversation and figure out what's going on. Indicators show when there are large gaps in time between posts to help make it clear when this takes place. Discussions can evolve over a longer period of time, and build up towards common understanding. The idea with a discussion forum is that we start to think through and clarify our ideas in writing, which is important in a remote organisation. If we're all the in the same room, it's easy to throw out and idea, see how it goes, and interact and adjust. With Remote, we need to take extra care in communicating this way, but we get way more time back in terms of uninterrupted time to really get work done. Net net the time it takes to write on forums pays back in multiples. Avoiding the \"wait until we speak\" trap Another big benefit to async-first is that the important group decisions happen faster. It seems counter-intuitive at first but consider this: We're prone to delaying conversations until we're together or on the phone, which slows us down. Since forums are asynchronous, there's no need to wait. Just post. Given we all have different schedules, this is faster than waiting for a scheduled call. Everyone can respond and move things forward without the waiting. Learning from each other at Source Camps Source Camp is a private unconference that runs every 2-3 months. This is your chance to learn whatever needs to be learned to advance yourself along the belt system. Each Source Camp will be focused on a specific track. Everyone who's made a significant personal contribution to any Source project is welcome to the Community track Source Camp. This includes Leancamp, Immersion, etc. The main vessel for self-improvement is Source Camp. These are open-ended events where you pull learning from the Source organisation, rather than have it pushed, like in school. The standard Source Camp \"agenda\" would be learning and creating together. What stories do we have to share about peer learning? What tools and methods have we tried out or developed, and how do the work? Source Camp is also an opportunity to build in some reflection on the interaction between Source as an organisation, and personal development. A check-in to share your experiences on personal development, and how Source is enabling/limiting it.

There are significant differences though: The org structure is very decentralised, enabling us to act as a swarm or independently as needed. Our squads are far more independent, choosing their own goals and tools. Our strategy is more emergent, and more informed by the front-line. Squad captains contribute to strategy. We call our approach the Speedboat Armada. Each squad is like a speedboat, with waterskiiers in tow. Each is self-directed, but coordinates with the others.","title":"Decentralised Agile"},{"location":"collaboration/decentralised-agile/#source-os","text":"The Source Operation System is our way of working, defined as a few simple practices. The idea with an \"Operating System\" with versions is to give everyone a clear sense of how things work, and we can step change with less confusion, rather than slowly shifting and trying to catch people up. Like an OS for your computer let's you focus on your work without needing to worry about how the computer works, Source OS is designed to allow you to focus on your work with almost no effort put towards management and coordination. (Coordination becomes a by-product of doing the real work.) The priority is to achieve connection and growth with our communities through the various products we have. Each product has a constituent user group: Leancamp, Deep Dive, Mentor Impact, Partnership Design, Decision Hacks, Source Summit, Brain Trust etc. The priority is to get Captains to (wo)man the boats, and to take initiatives in new squards to explore new ways to enable peer learning communities. Source OS is designed for Initiative Wayfinding Surplus time Personal development Source OS is designed to allow us to take initiatives of our own. If you have an idea, get it going yourself or start a speedboat. You're the captain of your own ship within the Source armada, and we coordinate at the Armada meeting every 2 months. So basically, we're aiming for more, smaller, self-directed teams that align themselves quarterly. The intention here is to step away from the problems caused by the lack of structure we've had previously, where we would wait for an initiative to get started by someone else, and then everyone would jump on it at once. This created a lot of needless complication, confusion and extra work for the initiators, and overloaded projects too early, just as they were getting momentum. Ultimately, creating organisational weakness at sales, communication and in delivering projects. So with Source OS, taking unilateral initiative on a project you lead is encouraged, and where you're not the squad leader or on the core team (on the speedboat), then you're expected to make yourself available to be delegated to. Urgency/busyness seems to be a constant everywhere. Although busyness hurts the business, it\u2019s fiercely contagious since the infected (aka busy people) are visibly suffering and thus seem to have the moral high-ground. Without active opposite pressure, their long hours and off-handed comments (\u201cwell, back to the old grindstone\u201d, \u201cyou guys go on home, I\u2019m going to get a little more done\u201d) will eventually swing the team. The biggest problem with this is that the people who can't manage their time well are always making themselves and others busy with busywork (meetings, impractical documentation, etc.) and fundamentally not getting results. As the team gravitates into their meeting blackhole, nobody gets results. Creating surplus time individually creates a new gravity well towards calm work that gets better results. Why? When you have surplus time, you make yourself available to act on the best opportunities, and act with the calmness and sure-footedness of someonw fresh and well-rested. With a busy schedule, there's no room to maneuvre and no gas left in the tank when you need it. So Source OS is designed to free everyone from meetings and busywork so we can all focus on real work, and be ready when needed to get the big results. Self-improvement and peer-support go hand in hand. This started on Day 1 on the beach in Gradina, and it's part of Source culture I really want to defend and grow. There is a skill-set part of personal development, relating to what we consider to be quality entrepreneurship education, and the role of the facilitator/curator there. There is also a creation part of personal development. Source is a resource you can employ to create great new things. What will you use Source for to make, and deliver on what the world needs?","title":"Source OS"},{"location":"collaboration/decentralised-agile/#the-speedboat-armada-model","text":"We are not a hierarchical company, we are an armada of speedboats, Mad Max style! Imagine an armada of speedboats, with waterskiiers in tow. Each project has leadership , sitting on the speedboat. They take responsibility for leading, organising, and they make the decisions. They drive the boat, and also do all the main work. These on-boat teams should stay small like startup founding teams so they can remain quick. If you're not in the leadership (on the boat), you can be a waterskiier (on a rope). This means you're willing to help, and to be pulled in. You follow the project's updates, and are responsive on internal communications. This could be part of the delivery, or it can be an offer to advise, take calls, etc. The idea is that we can use On Boat (core to delivery, making decisions) and On Rope (watching, ready and able to be delegated specific responsibilities) as shortcuts to set expectations on commitment and communication. You'll hear things like \"I'm on rope on Erasmus+\" meaning they're following that project and have made their availabilit to happy clear. With smaller core teams, we'll be more efficient and quicker to jump on opportunities. Also, we get better at building momentum since our energy goes into growth and impact, rather than management and coordination. Projects should start with just leadership, and people can rope on. The leaders can \"pull people in\", as they're needed. The trade off is that unless you start a squad (or commit to it very early), you're going to be more of a \"band-wagon jumper\" so you might have to wait longer for the momentum to build up, before the project's engine is strong enough to tow you. (Consider LIF in London and The Africa Prize in Ghana, with too many waterskiiers to coordinate. This is why we want to organise ourselves for smaller teams.) One of the big ideas with this shift is to create an incentive for everyone to take the lead on something new, and build a small agile team to do it, building lots of powerful engines to pull us. That's way more effective than pooling a lot of resources into a single team with a lot of different objectives to manage. With the Speedboat Armada Model, we create space to see more leadership emerge within Source without bumping into existing initiatives. If you see a way to enable peer learning at Source or with Source's help, go for it. You'll gain our support, and will even probably attract a small squad around you. You just need to agree on OKRs with the other squad captains and the admiral and you're all set.","title":"The Speedboat Armada Model"},{"location":"collaboration/decentralised-agile/#products-not-projects","text":"Speedboats deliver user-focused products.

They also look ahead to where these groups of boats are heading in the medium and long-term, doing recon, research, making useful connections, and generally making sure the coast is clear.

They are skill-complete, including whoever is necessary to do their work. The makeup differs by squad - could be a facilitator, coder, marketer... Crews make the decisions together and do the work, and importantly they take responsibility for achieving the OKR. In Agile terms, Crew is a synonym for squad. They are the core 2-4 people delivering the product. Water-skiiers - help the crew by making themselves available and contributing when asked. They are responsible for keeping up with the progress of the crew, but only accept specific responsibilities when someone in the crew delegates to them. For example, they are not on the weekly meetings, but still expected to follow along the async crew communication and be responsive when they are tagged in a forum message. These map to Agile roles Product Owner Scrum Master Squad The product leader takes on the role of product owner which means it's their responsibility to understand the customers, users, stakeholders and the strategic needs of Source. Their job is to set priorities with the team, and be available as a check-in or proxy for the rest of the team when there's a question about what's right for the user. The delivery manager sets the team up for successful delivery. Remove obstacles, or blockers to progress, constantly helping the team become more self organising. They enable the work a team does rather than impose how it\u2019s done. Their role in this is to facilitate project meetings- including stand-ups , sprint planning meetings , and retrospectives . They also track progress and produce artefacts for showing this, like burn down/up charts. They must be able to enable the team to produce estimates of how much effort is required to produce features that the Product Manager wants. The team self-organises to delver (ship) working products at the end of every sprint.

Another example, The Sources is an application of on-demand storytelling. We can apply on-demand storytelling for educating geoduck divers or freedom fighters . But first, we have to develop the general technique with The Sources. Ideally, we develop both in parallel as both together will drive Source towards its impact goals, but generally we find that the most useful research and R&D starts with a real need. Those usually look like a simple novel solution, which we later develop into something more broadly useful at Source Camps.

Our communication culture is similar to Basecamp, and their communication guide is worth a read to understand the ethos. But let's get practical for now. The forum is for all discussions that: are important enough to need to be referred to after tomorrow require more than 30 seconds to respond The forum is divided into different categories so you can follow along or ignore and catch up later: The Check-In category is for high-level updates Each speedboat team has it's own category for their own discussions There are open categories for general and public discussions Chat on Telegram is for: random, social stuff quick answers that don't require time to respond and where you care more about a fast answer than a thoughtful one (Nobody is required to be on chat, only on the forum.)

Without that context, restarting a discussion that took place a few days ago is difficult, let alone a few months ago. Chat content basically dissolves. Plus the busier chat gets, the more people feel pressure to live in chat, so everyone ends up hating it. On forums, it is easy to continue discussions over any period of time. New members can even pick up on a conversation and figure out what's going on. Indicators show when there are large gaps in time between posts to help make it clear when this takes place. Discussions can evolve over a longer period of time, and build up towards common understanding. The idea with a discussion forum is that we start to think through and clarify our ideas in writing, which is important in a remote organisation. If we're all the in the same room, it's easy to throw out and idea, see how it goes, and interact and adjust.

Remote work without the meetings \"Remote\" is a totally different way of working. You can't just start using Zoom and chatrooms, otherwise they take over your life. There's actual work to do, and we want to optimise for the people who actually get things done. With Source collaborations, we have very few meetings, and no video call or chatrooms required. (They always end up horrible, so why make people use them.) At Source, everyone has mostly uninterrupted days to really get things done. They are in control of their own schedule, and rarely have to work around other people's timezones or personal routines. A lot of people can't imagine remote work without calls and chats, but the switch to this kind of remote work is actually easy! It just needs people to turn their attention to self-awareness, to jump in to new habits, and help each other break our old ones. The Source Rules Of Remote How does Source work practically? A few easy rules: Every week or so, write a quick note to update everyone with your current priorities. If you get mentioned on the forum, reply within one business day. (This makes the forum the single source of truth). If a teammate calls, get back to them the same day. (And don't call if it's not important enough to require a call back the same day.) If you're on a squad, commit to be on the weekly standup call, which is voice-only and 20 minutes max. (It's a great deal, to free your week of all other meetings.) At the end of the project, everyone attends the retrospective and shares the conclusions on the forum so we all learn from each other. This way of communicating gives us a lot of control over our schedule, and a lot more free time, but it needs us to rethink our roles and responsibilities. Choose \"Async\" Favour asynchronous communication (like the forum) over synchronous (chat and voice). And specifically - if something's important, we put it on the forum. Thoughts on big decisions, teammate updates, etc. - that stuff goes in writing because: it's inclusive - everyone is in the loop it's respectful - we can read and respond on own schedule it promotes thoughtfulness - writing helps us articulate our thinking more clearly from the start Squads instead of managers Squads form around projects (with one-time end results) or factories (to produce a similar output repeatedly) Squads are a maximum of 4 people to stay agile. If a squad needs to be bigger than 4 people, we instead designate 2-3 people as squad members (drive the boat) and the rest as water-skiiers (follow and help when pulled in.) Squad members pick their own tools. The organisation doesn't force tools on them, but also nobody outside of the squad is expected to use the tools the squad uses. Each squad member holds themselves accountable. The best thing about no manager is also the worst -- there's nobody there the chase you. Teams prioritise together Squads take responsibility for their results and direction, and report that to everyone else. Squads set their own OKRs but these are usually related to higher-level OKRs set by the organisation leadership. My squads have a single, mandatory 20-minute agile standup call that happens at the same time each week. No updates or \"while I've got you\" stuff, since those happened already on the forum. We only prioritize the upcoming week's work together. Organizing around priorities, not tasks Everyone communicates their top 3+ priorities (what they're working on, and their short-term goals) every week or so. This way, everyone knows what's going on and if they should connect with each other. It also creates a sense of peer accountability and peer support. Watch out for \"ripples\" Teamwork is interconnected, so if someone's stuck or delayed, it affects others. In remote teams, this is harder to see, so it's important to speak up if you're stuck. If someone is completely stuck, call a \"block\" so all hands drop what they're doing and come to their support. Blocks are immediately followed by a 30-minute root cause session, so we can use the opportunity to improve for next time. Reject urgency It's disrupted when someone does something last-minute, and ends up pulling everyone into that last-minuteness. If this becomes a pattern, everyone gets caught up in the urgent instead of the important. But we can break these urgency habits, leaving us all in flow, working calmly while still seeing big results. Chat is for social stuff only The worst thing in the universe is having to follow yet another chatroom. We so no to FOMO. Chat is strictly for social, fun and random stuff only. So its optional and you can tune out without worry. (Because if it's important, it's on the forum anyway!) Calls are 1-to-1 and unscheduled Calls are used sparingly, but sometimes a voice conversation is the right way to go. Things like brainstorms, quick clarifications, or discussions that involve a lot of Q&A back-and-forth - and anything that gets a little emotional -- it's time for a call. After the call, write a quick note on the forum so everyone's in the loop and clear. That's it. Simple, and its worked great.

We've only published a few here, but we're happy to share more if you can't find your use case here. Turning a large group into a community A conference or a large chatroom is often called a community, but is it? We define community as a place where like-minded people find each other and form meaningful relationships. Once people are drawn together, that's half the challenge. The other half is helping them find each other. Flocks (as in \"birds of a feather flock together\") is a way to help people find their flock in a large space. Really helping each other Community leaders and educators often think about inviting experts, either to give talks or answer questions. But often the answers to individual challenges isn't found in an expert, but a peer who's walked down the same road. Our experience taught us that sharing practical experience (not talking about it, but doing it) is more likely to build connections and knowledge in a community. Even invited experts get better results with practical ways to engage rather than just being a talking head. (And for them, it's both funner and more educational.) Clinic is a way for a project-based learner to get more apprenticeship-like guidance from someone else. Others can observe and learn, and Clinics can be setup easily for a sequence of different learners, making much better use of busy experts' time. Show How is a way to transfer more practical know-how, allowing learners to instantly apply what they've learned.","title":"Peer Learning Formats"},{"location":"formats/#peer-learning-formats","text":"Info Over a decade, Source has developed several dozen tried-and-test formats.

A challenger, who has their own real challenge to solve, and an expert, who has some relevant experience in that area, will work together in a fixed timebox. It starts with a description of the challenge and a bit of its history, and then moves to working on a specific artifact together. The expert shows them by doing, but works in challengers context. By working on something tangible together, the challenger and the audience learn practical approaches.

Overview A lot of people pushing the state of the art don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re succeeding. Flocks aims to allow people to find each other based on commonalities in their personal struggles. Since many people have part of the answer, just meeting each other allows them to connect their pieces \u2013 allowing more holistic and thorough solutions to form. The format starts by stating this, and then inviting people to fill out a Flocks poster. They quickly present it, and post it on a wall somewhere in the room, where they stay. After the posters are created, people circulate the room like a tradeshow, gravitating to the posters that resonate with them and meeting like-minded people.

Peer Learning Principles Learners take responsibility of their learning journey. Educators create environments that inspire and allow them to self-direct. Create safe spaces so the learner can ask real questions and reveal true challenges. Systematically create relationships to supply the most relevant sources of experience to the learning demand. Those may be authorities, or maybe those just a few steps ahead. Preparation Print out large (A2 or A1) Flocks posters. Print roughly 10-20% of the number of people who will be in the room. Print out small (A4) Flocks posters. Print roughly 20% of the number of people who will be in the room.

If not, tell early-stage stories of big innovators before they were famous. Allow 2-3 minutes for lining up and writing, then up to 15 minutes for presenting.

Useful when Context is important for the learner, and they need to process others\u2019 experience in terms of relevance to them and/or the skills necessary to succeed. Overview It\u2019s one thing to explain to someone how you did something, quite another to show them.

Show & Tell allows someone with a relevant experience \u2013 either successful or not -- to share valuable lessons learned. Rather than just tell a story, walking through it step-by-step prompts contextual explanations and questions. Walking through it with the key tools and artifacts makes the entire exercise practical. When those particular artifacts are shown up front, then the story, the lessons learned and the conclusion (if any) can all be discussed around that.
