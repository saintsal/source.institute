										<p>Taking technology to market in Africa requires African known-how, so we started <a href="http://thesources.co">The Sources</a>. We found 60+ African entrepreneurs with unique successes, and asked others to help interview.  The topics that mattered were far from business school, like building rural distribution networks or networking in modern tribal cultures. </p>

										<p>Each year, the LIF program picks hundreds of engineers, from Colombia to Egypt to China to Thailand, and helps them commercialise their inventions.  Peer learning acheive got consistently high results across the range of cultures and countries supported.  It also outperformed lectures and coaching, both in applied knowledge and in commercial relationships made. 
										<p class="footnote">* In 2016, after 3 years of delivering LIF, we sold our operations in this project to Lino Velev's company, Far Star, which operates it using Source material under license until March 2020.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Small changes with big results</h2>
										<p>We've introduced peer learning to global networks, like City AI and Lean Startup Summit, immediately doubling satisfaction scores and seeing our formats syndicated. We also zoomed into to local challenges, like enabling Roma teenagers in Bulgaria to support each other to develop their own coding skills.  Over 10 years, we've run several hundred unconferences, from 30 to 800 people, on four continents.

												<p>When a new discipline is still emerging, how do you educate people in that subject? There are no established experts, no books, and no agreement in best practices, so where do you begin?

												<p><em>Peer Learning Is...</em>is about practical peer learning in different forms. 

												<p>It covers our role modelsâ€™ stories, like Harvard and Y Combinator in the US, MEST in Ghana, FarmHack in the Netherlands and Pirate Summit in Germany. And we share how we took what we learned from them to create some world-class education programs and globally-known communities of practice like The Sources, The Africa Prize For Engineering and the Lean Startup movement.
