Source Institute is a skunkworks.  It grows and shrinks according to the projects it takes on, each of which is approached as a collaboration.

In most ways, Source is a decentralised organisation, with a remote-first culture, and squads that form and disband as needed. At it's largest, Source squads consisted of 40 people, running 5 programs on 3 continents.
