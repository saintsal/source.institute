| [Polygon Ecosystem DAO](https://forum.polygon.technology/)  | 2021- | Polygon is a scalable layer 1 protocol that's popular among Ethereum projects, and a top 10 cryptocurrency. We're enabling the early generation of the Polygon ecosystem through grants, education and support. |
| [Bankless DAO](https://www.bankless.community/)  | 2021- |Bankless DAO is a large-scale DAO aligned to help the world go bankless by using fairer, decentralised alternatives. I'm working within the DAO to help impliment peer learning best practices, helping surface and share defi (decentralised finance) expert practices, and optimise content creation for various DAO projects. |
| [LimeAcademy](https://limeacademy.tech/) | 2021 |  LimeAcademy is a developer training course run by LimeChain, one of Bulgaria's leading blockchain development agencies. Using Mentor Impact (see below), I trained the senior developers to be mentors, and aligned the program around desired learner capabilities and behaviours. |

Heavy use of facilitated peer support and startup community interaction made multiplied the key success metrix by 5X. |

This proof-of-concept was notably successful because of the emphasis on peer support. There's an overlap between software developer culture and Roma culture, that activated self-direction in the teenagers. |
| [AIESEC Startup Deep Dive](http://aiesec.net ) | 2016-2017 | An 8-hour, hands-on workshop, simulating the muddy exploration and hard decisions that founders face when getting their ideas off the ground.
